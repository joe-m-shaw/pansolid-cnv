\note{
Excel spreadsheets for coordinating testing on the PanSolid QIAseq
enrichment are manually curated by the tech team and stored either on the S
drive or on the laboratory Sharepoint. This function uses versions of
these Excel spreadsheets copied onto a local drive.

The sample_id field has some surprises. Example: 23024772 has a degree sign (Â°)
entered after it which is invisible in Excel and R.
