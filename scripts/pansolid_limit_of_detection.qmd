# Background

This is a limit of detection experiment using SeraCare reference materials to test the sensitivity of the PanSolid pipeline for detecting copy number variants at low neoplastic cell contents (NCC).

A previous limit of detection experiment was performed on 01/03/2024, with DNA mixes representing 25%, 12.5%, 6.25% and 0% NCC. This was due to the limited volumes of SeraCare reference materials available.

The aim of this new experiment is to end up with 5 mixes, each representing NCC samples (100%, 50%, 20%, 10% and 0%). This should harmonise the limit of detection for amplifications with the limit of detection for single nucleotide variants.

Each mix will have the same total DNA input as a standard clinical sample:

-   20 ul of 6ng/ul DNA
-   `r round(20*6, 0)`ng DNA
-   `r round(((20*6)*1000) / 3.3, 0)` haploid genome copies (1 haploid human genome weighs 3.3 picograms)

Of this, the following amounts are taken as the input into the fragmentation, end-repair and A-addition reaction:

-   16.75ul
-   `r round(16.75*6, 1)` ng
-   `r round(((16.75*6)*1000) / 3.3, 0)` haploid genome copies

## Samples

The "tumour" sample is the Seraseq® Solid Tumor CNV Mix (+12 copies of various genes including ERBB2).

The "normal" sample is the Seraseq® DNA WT Mix (no additional gene copies).

The documentation for the Seraseq® Solid Tumor CNV Mix and the Seraseq® DNA WT Mix state that the DNA concentrations are 10.9 ng/ul and 28.8 ng/ul, respectively, when measured with the Qubit dsDNA Broad Range assay.

I measured each control using the Qubit dsDNA Broad Range assay in the lab and the DNA concentrations were 7.28 ng/ul and 22.4 ng/ul.
