## Quarto

*"Under the hood, prose in Quarto documents (.qmd files) is written in Markdown, a lightweight set of conventions for formatting plain text files."*

Control+alt+I is a useful shortcut for creating a code chunk.

*"Your chunk labels should be short but evocative and should not contain spaces. We recommend using dashes (-) to separate words (instead of underscores, \_) and avoiding other special characters in chunk labels."*

```{r}
1 + 1
```
