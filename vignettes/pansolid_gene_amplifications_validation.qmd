# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

At the North West GLH, testing for somatic DNA variants is performed using the QIAseq methodology (Qiagen) [@xu2017] and Illumina next generation sequencing (NGS) using a large enrichment panel of QIAseq primers named "PanSolid". The current PanSolid enrichment, referred to as PanSolidv2 (design identifier: CDHS-48608Z-11752) contains `r length(unique(primer_df$primer))` unique QIAseq primers for `r length(unique(target_df$region))` target gene regions. Sequencing data from the PanSolid enrichment is analysed with a pipeline built in the Qiagen CLC Genomic Workbench. Detection of single nucleotide variants and indels on PanSolid has previously been validated ([DOC6024 Validation of QIASeq PanSolid Enrichment]{custom-style="Strong"}). Currently, copy number variants (CNVs) are analysed using a separate QIAseq "Core" panel with a bespoke pipeline written in Python, with copy number amplifications reported for 4 genes: *EGFR*, *ERBB2*, *AR* and *MET* ([DOC4914 Validation of QiaSeq UMI Based Copy Number Analysis]{custom-style="Strong"}). The long-term aim is to move all CNV detection to the PanSolid panel and the CLC pipeline.

The detection of *ERBB2* gene amplifications was validated on the PanSolid enrichment in April 2024 ([DOC6260: Validation of Detecting Somatic *ERBB2* Amplifications with the PanSolid CLC Pipeline]{custom-style="Strong"}). *ERBB2* amplifications were prioritised for validation due to service needs, and were validated by comparison with results from droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) testing. The aim of this validation document is to validate additional amplification genes on the PanSolid workflow.

## Somatic Gene Amplifications {#sec-somatic-gene-amplifications}

Gene amplification is a common mechanism in the development of cancer [@matsui2013]. Additional gene copies can be present on extra-chromosomal DNA rather than their initial chromosomal loci [@verhaak2019], for example *EGFR* amplifications can be present on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) fragments referred to as "double minutes" [@french2019]. "Double minute" refers to a very small ("minute") bodies of chromatin material with two arms ("double) which were originally visualised by chromosome staining [@cox1965], which have been found to be generated by chromothripsis [@shoshani2021]. The location of genes on ecDNA allows them to be copied many times, and uneven inheritance of ecDNA into daughter cells promotes heterogeneity within the tumour which can act as an"evolutionary force" in cancer development [@decarvalho2018]. The number of additional gene copies can vary between genes and tumour types, ranging as high as hundreds of gene copies. There is no consistent accepted threshold of copy number to classify a gene as "amplified", although many clinical trials use a threshold of 10 copies as an entry requirement.

Gene amplifications can have clinical relevance for choice of treatment and predicting resistance to treatment, particularly amplifications of genes encoding tyrosine kinase membrane receptors. It is predicted that increasing the gene copy number increases the levels of translated protein, which maintains aberrant cell signalling even in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [@tanaka2020]. Historically, gene amplifications were detected with fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), but NGS methods are being increasingly used.

### Gene Coordinates {#sec-gene-coordinates}

```{r}
#| label: pansolid-genes

  unnest(single_locus) |> 
  select(single_locus) |> 
  filter(!duplicated(single_locus)) |> 
  arrange(single_locus)

```

The PanSolid enrichment includes primer targeting `r length(unique(pansolid_target_loci$single_locus))` different gene loci. Of these, there are 9 genes which were selected as having amplifications with clinical relevance (@tbl-amplification-coordinates).

### Clinical Impact {#sec-clinical-impact}

The clinical impact of amplifications in these genes is summarised below:

-   ***ALK***: *ALK* amplifications are observed in many cancer types, and confer a poor prognosis in neuroblastoma [@shreenivas2023].

-   ***BRAF***: *BRAF* amplification is a mechanism of resistance to BRAF inhibitor medications in melanoma [@proietti2020].

-   ***EGFR***: *EGFR* amplifications can be targeted by EGFR inhibitor medications [@french2019].

-   ***ERBB2***: *ERBB2* amplifications are associated with resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in colorectal cancer [@ross2018] and can be targeted with the drug Herceptin in breast cancer [@swain2023; @slamon2001].

-   ***MDM2***: *MDM2* amplifications are linked to TKI resistance in multiple cancers [@hou2019] and targeted anti-MDM2 treatments are in development [@sciot2021].

-   ***MET***: *MET* amplification is associated with resistance to EGFR-TKIs [@wang2019; @qin2023].

-   ***MYC***: *MYC* amplification is a poor prognostic indicator in patients with medulloblastoma [@sursal2022].

-   ***MYCN***: *MYCN* amplifications are found in several cancer types, including medulloblastoma [@sursal2022], and is associated with high-risk prognosis in neuroblastoma [@cohn2009; @irwin2021].

-   ***SMO***: determination of *SMO* copy number by FISH is specified for medulloblastoma on the [NHS National Genomic Test Directory](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-genomic-test-directories/) (code M194). The SMO protein is a target for several therapeutics [@rimkus2016].

## Requirements {#sec-requirements}

The requirements for this new method are as follows:

1.  **Clinical utility:** the test should provide clear results for the 9 listed amplification genes.

2.  **Clinical validity:** the test should have a defined sensitivity and specificity for these markers, calculated by comparison with an orthogonal test.

3.  **Dosage accuracy:** it should be shown how accurate the test is at detecting amplifications of different copy number states, expressed as a correlation between the test and copy numbers from an orthogonal test.

4.  **Quality control:** the test should have clear quality control thresholds for deciding when the test results should be reported and when the test has failed.

5.  **Variability:** the test should have defined intra-run variation (repeatability) and inter-run variation (repeatability) for these amplifications.

6.  **Visualisation:** the results should be presented in a clear and visual manner.

7.  **Analysis:** there should be a clear procedure for analysis of gene amplifications by laboratory staff.

```

## Samples {#sec-methods-samples}

Samples were received at the North West GLH between 
`r format.Date(x = min(pansolid_sample_info$date_sample_received), format = "%B %Y")`
and
`r format.Date(x = max(pansolid_sample_info$date_sample_received), format = "%B %Y")`. Details of the normal control cohort used for the PanSolid CLC pipeline are given in the *ERBB2* validation document ([DOC6260]{custom-style="Strong"}). In total, `r length(unique(amp_validation_stdev_results_collated$labno))` different DNA samples were tested on the PanSolid version 2 enrichment during this validation. Samples were tested from patients with age at sample receipt ranging from `r round(min(pansolid_sample_info$years_at_sample_receipt, na.rm = TRUE), 0)` to `r round(max(pansolid_sample_info$years_at_sample_receipt, na.rm = TRUE), 0)` years (median: `r round(median(pansolid_sample_info$years_at_sample_receipt, na.rm = TRUE), 0)` years), and from reference materials provided by the company SeraCare ([https://www.seracare.com/]()) (@sec-methods-reference-materials). Samples from many different types of cancer were tested, which are summarised in the Supplementary Information (@tbl-cancer-types). The details of the sample types (@tbl-tissue-types) and neoplastic cell contents (NCC) (@tbl-ncc) are also provided in the Supplementary Information.

## Reference Materials {#sec-methods-reference-materials}

### SeraCare reference materials {#sec-seracare-reference-materials}

Reference materials were ordered from the company SeraCare to act as positive controls for different gene amplifications. Each control consists of DNA extracted from a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sample of a stable cell line (GM24385), spiked with plasmid DNA for specific genes at different quantities. The amplified genes included in the SeraCare reference materials are shown in @tbl-seracare-reference-material-genes. The details of the SeraCare reference materials, including DNA numbers and batch numbers, are shown in the Supplementary Information (@tbl-seracare-reference-material-details).

```{r}

                                           "seracare_sample_details.csv")) 

kable(seracare_gene_overlap)

```

### Limit of detection DNA mixtures {#sec-methods-lod-mixtures}

A limit of detection experiment was performed using the Seraseq® Solid Tumor CNV Mix, +12 copies reference material (DNA number 24039973), which represented DNA from tumour cells, and the Seraseq® TNA (DNA) WT Mix (DNA number 24039975), which represented DNA from normal cells. The two reference materials were mixed together to mimic samples with NCCs of 30%, 20%, 10% and 0%. The final volume of each DNA mixture was 20 µl and the total DNA concentration was 6 ng/µl, which is the standard input for the PanSolid NGS workflow. These DNA mixtures were made on worksheet WS144265 and run on the PanSolid version 2 NGS workflow on worksheet WS144291. This limit of detection experiment is different to the limit of detection experiment performed on the PanSolid version 1 workflow for the validation of *ERBB2* amplifications ([DOC6260]{custom-style="Strong"}).

## DNA extraction {#sec-methods-dna-extraction}

For the majority of samples, DNA was extracted using the QIASymphony extraction method (QIAsymphony DSP DNA Mini Kit, Qiagen) ([DOC6251: QIAsymphony DNA FFPE Extraction Procedure]{custom-style="Strong"}). The summary of DNA extraction methods is shown in the supplementary information (@tbl-extraction-types).

## Next generation sequencing

```{r}
#| label: pansolid-worksheets
#| include: FALSE

pansolid_ws <- read_csv(file = paste0(data_folder,
                                      "validation/processed/",
                                      "pansolid_worksheet_details.csv"),
                        show_col_types = FALSE)

```

Samples were tested on version 2 (CDHS-48608Z-11752) of the PanSolid QIAseq enrichment ([DOC5925: QIAseq PanSolid DNA Panel NGS Library Preparation]{custom-style="Strong"}) with 2 × 150 bp paired-end sequencing on an Illumina Novaseq. The NGS data described in this validation document comes from `r length(unique(pansolid_ws$pcrid))` worksheets performed between `r format.Date(x = min(pansolid_ws$date), format = "%B %Y")` and `r format.Date(x = max(pansolid_ws$date), format = "%B %Y")` .

## Bioinformatic analysis {#sec-methods-bioinformatics}

The CLC pipeline, including details of the methodology and quality metrics, is described in detail in the *ERBB2* amplifications validation document ([DOC6260]{custom-style="Strong"}). The method by which CLC detects CNVs is also described in the  Qiagen Copy Number Variant Detection White Paper (@qiagen2015). Brief details are provided below.

### Control cohort

A cohort of 25 normal FFPE samples from various tissue sources was used a control cohort for CNV calling with the pipeline. DNA was extracted from these samples using the QIAsymphony method.

### Graining level

The CLC Genomics Workbench has 3 "graining levels" which determine the resolution for CNV analysis (@qiagen2023):

**Coarse:** for CNVs spanning over 10 targets

**Intermediate:** for CNVs spanning over 5 targets

**Fine:** most sensitive to CNVs spanning 3 or more targets.

All amplification genes were initially analysed on the "coarse" setting. Preliminary work showed that the coarse setting could not identify *MYC* amplifications in positive controls, as *MYC* has only 3 targets on the PanSolid enrichment (@tbl-amplification-coordinates). The "fine" setting was then used specifically for *MYC* to account for the lower number of QIAseq targets in this gene. *MYCN* was added to the project later, and was also analysed on the "fine" setting.

### Fold change

The CLC pipeline identifies CNVs according to the fold change of target regions. Fold change is defined in the following equation:

Fold change (gain) = locus coverage / baseline control coverage

### Signal-adjusted noise

The “signal-adjusted noise” metric is a quality control metric developed during the *ERBB2* amplifications validation. It is defined as the standard deviation of target log2ratios when regional fold-changes are excluded. This quality metric was adapted from work performed at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust (North Thames GLH).

### Visualisation

Results were visualised using an Excel output as before, and also using a new interactive HTML output (@fig-pansolid-visualisation-png).

![Visualisation of gene amplifications on PanSolid. The upper panel shows the Excel output for sample 24026871 which has a *MYC* amplification. The bottom panel shows the HTML output for the same sample, with tracks for CNV calls, log2 ratios and B-allele frequency.](pansolid_visualisation_output.png){#fig-pansolid-visualisation-png}

### Pipeline version

The version of the PanSolid CLC pipeline tested in this validation was PanSolid Workflow v2.2.

## Orthogonal testing {#sec-orthogonal-testing}

### Droplet digital PCR for *ERBB2*, *MYC*, *MET*, *BRAF* and *EGFR* {#sec-methods-ddpcr}

Amplification results for the *ERBB2*, *MYC*, *MET*, *BRAF* and *EGFR* genes were confirmed using ddPCR. ddPCR assays were designed using the workflow for confirming constitutional CNVs, which involves a universal forward primer and a reference assay for the *AP3B1* gene on chromosome 5 ([DOC4304 CNV Confirmation Using Droplet Digital PCR]{custom-style="Strong"}). ddPCR was performed using a BioRad QX200 system with 5ng DNA input per well. Each assay was validated for use and then used to test DNA from clinical FFPE samples and SeraCare controls. The results for the *ERBB2* ddPCR were previously reported in [DOC6260]{custom-style="Strong"}. Details of the primer and probe sequences (tbl-ddpcr-primers, @tbl-ap3b1-ddpcr-primers and @tbl-ddpcr-probes), reaction mix (@tbl-ddpcr-mix) and thermocycling conditions (@tbl-ddpcr-thermocycler-programme) are given in the Supplementary Information.

### Whole genome sequencing {#sec-methods-wgs}

Samples which had been tested using whole genome sequencing (WGS) were selected for this validation, which included samples from the Tessa Jowell BRAIN MATRIX Platform Study (clinical trial identifier NCT04274283) [@watts2022]. WGS was performed on DNA extracted from fresh-frozen tissue by Illumina Laboratory Services at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, as part of the NHS Genomics Medicine Service. FFPE tissue from the same tumour block as the fresh frozen tissue used for WGS was used as the sample source for PanSolid testing. Samples included in this validation were analysed by WGS between December 2022 to February 2024, using the "somatic variants and pertinent germline findings in cancer susceptibility genes" pipeline version 2.28 to version 3.6.2. WGS results were taken directly from the HTML reports generated by the Genomics England pipeline for domains 1, 2 and 3.

## Validation analysis {#sec-methods-validation-analysis}

The validation analysis was performed using the R programming language (version 4.4.1) [@rcore2024] relying mainly on packages from the tidyverse [@wickham2019]. This validation document is written and rendered using Quarto [@Allaire_Quarto_2024] and is publicly available on [Github](https://github.com/joeshaw824/pansolid_cnv_validation).

## Data locations {#sec-data-locations}

Overall `r nrow(amp_validation_stdev_results_collated)` replicates from `r length(unique(amp_validation_stdev_results_collated$labno))` different samples were tested using the PanSolid NGS workflow. Of these, `r nrow(good_quality_samples)` had signal-adjusted noise metrics within the acceptable range of 0-0.7. There were 
`r sum(tbl_amp_gene_summary$Amplifications)` amplifications with fold changes above the threshold of 2.8 detected in the 9 target genes (@tbl-amp-gene-summary). 
Amplification fold changes ranged from just above the threshold at `r min_fold_change_detected` to `r max_fold_change_detected`, and were detected across a range of different cancer types (@fig-pansolid-results-by-cancer-type-plot).

## Coarse setting: *ALK*, *BRAF*, *EGFR*, *ERBB2*, *MET*, *MDM2* and *SMO* results {#sec-results-coarse-setting}

The CLC coarse setting detected amplifications in all the target genes except the *ALK* gene (@tbl-amp-gene-summary). The 1 amplification detected in the *SMO* gene was a false positive in a sample with a signal-adjusted noise value of 0.89 (DNA number 23032153). For the remaining genes, a range of amplifications were detected. For each gene, there was variation in the amplified region, which in some cases only included the gene of interest and in others expanded to include additional genomic regions. In nearly all cases, every exon in the canonical RefSeq gene transcript was contained within the amplified region. There were 3 samples where 2 separate amplified regions were detected in the *EGFR* gene, whilst for other samples only a single region call was made. Plots showing the range of amplification coordinates for each gene are included in the Supplementary Information (@fig-egfr-wide to @fig-mdm2-zoom).

## Fine setting: *MYC* and *MYCN* results {#sec-results-fine-setting}

```{r}
#| label: myc-amplifications
#| echo: FALSE

myc_samples <- amp_validation_pos_cnv_results_collated |>

mycn_samples <- amp_validation_pos_cnv_results_collated |> 
  filter(gene == "MYCN" & !labno %in% seracare_details$`DNA number`)

```

Due to their reduced size, the *MYC* and *MYCN* genes were analysed on a separate "fine" setting for CNV calling. Amplifications for the *MYC* gene were detected in `r length(unique(myc_samples$labno))` samples (excluding the SeraCare reference materials), with fold changes ranging from `r round(min(myc_samples$fold_change), 1)` to `r round(max(myc_samples$fold_change), 1)`, whilst a *MYCN* amplification was only detected in `r length(unique(mycn_samples$labno))` sample (excluding the SeraCare reference materials) with a fold change of `r round(mycn_samples$fold_change, 1)`. The full width of the *MYC* gene was covered in all calls except for sample 24031627, in which only the latter 2 exons of the gene had an amplification (@fig-myc-zoom). In one sample (24024116) a focal *MYC* amplification was detected on a background of increased fold change across all targets on 8q, indicating an 8q gain (@fig-sample-24024116-whole-genome). Coordinate plots for the *MYCN* gene are shown in the supplementary information (@fig-mycn-wide and @fig-mycn-zoom).

## Comparison to ddPCR {#sec-results-ddpcr-comparison}

ddPCR was performed for a selection of samples for the *BRAF*, *EGFR*, *ERBB2*, *MET* and *MYC* genes. The *ERBB2* ddPCR work was performed as part of the separate validation of *ERBB2* amplification detection ([DOC6260]{custom-style="Strong"}), which included DNA extracted on the Cobas and QIAsymphony methods. 11 *ERBB2* samples extracted with the QIAsymphony method and tested on PanSolid version 2 are included in this validation analysis, and compared to the ddPCR results for their corresponding Cobas extractions. The QIAsymphony method was validated as the sole DNA extraction method for FFPE tissue at the Manchester GLH in April 2024. A copy number threshold of 5 was used to classify ddPCR results as "amplified" and "non-amplified". There was good agreement between ddPCR and PanSolid, with only 5 discrepant results out of 97 samples (@tbl-ddpcr-vs-pansolid) and an overall sensitivity of 93% (@tbl-ddpcr-vs-pansolid-metrics).

### ddPCR dosage correlation {#sec-ddpcr-dosage-correlation}

### ddPCR discordant results {#sec-ddpcr-discordant-results}

Three samples had a discordant result from ddPCR when compared to the PanSolid NGS result. Two of these samples (24002064 and 23033921) had borderline results on both ddPCR and PanSolid NGS. The remaining sample (24037724) had a *MYC* copy number of 9 on ddPCR, with a fold change of only 2.2 detected on PanSolid NGS (@tbl-ddpcr-false-negatives). The whole genome plot for this sample showed a deletion at chromosome 5q, including the location of the *AP3B1* ddPCR reference gene (5q14.1), which probably caused an artificially high ddPCR copy number.

  filter(method_name == "Fresh tissue")

```

DNA from patient samples previously tested by WGS was also tested using PanSolid NGS. In total, there were `r length(unique(pansolid_wgs_samples$labno))` samples tested from `r length(unique(pansolid_wgs_samples$nhsno))` patients, using 3 different extraction methods: `r nrow(pansolid_wgs_samples_qs)` had DNA extracted from FFPE tissue via the QIAsymphony method, `r nrow(pansolid_wgs_samples_cobas)` had DNA extracted from FFPE tissue via the Cobas method and `r nrow(pansolid_wgs_samples_ff)` had DNA extracted from fresh frozen tissue.

The PanSolid NGS amplification results for the `r length(amp_genes$gene)` target genes (@tbl-amplification-coordinates) were compared against the results from WGS for the same genes where the variant type was listed as "DUP" or "GAIN". WGS did detect copy number losses and regions of loss of heterozygosity in some target genes, but these were excluded as the current aim of the PanSolid CLC pipeline is to detect gene amplifications.

Results were compared for samples extracted using the QIAsymphony method, as this is now the validated DNA extraction method for FFPE samples at the North West GLH (Manchester site). One sample (PanSolid NGS lab number: 24018922; WGS lab number: 24015386) was excluded from the comparison as the FFPE shavings used for QIAsymphony extraction had a different pathology block identifier to the fresh frozen samples used for WGS. Another sample (PanSolid NGS lab number: 24030364) was excluded from the comparison as it had a signal adjusted noise value above 1.

  filter(cnv_class %in% c("DUP", "GAIN") & cnv_copy_number < 10 &
           gene %in% amp_genes$gene)

```

In the WGS results there were `r nrow(wgs_cnvs_below_ten)` copy number gains in the targeted genes which had total copy numbers below 10, ranging from `r min(wgs_cnvs_below_ten$cnv_copy_number)` - `r max(wgs_cnvs_below_ten$cnv_copy_number)` (`r min(wgs_cnvs_below_ten$cnv_copy_number) - 2` - `r max(wgs_cnvs_below_ten$cnv_copy_number) - 2` additional copies). The PanSolid pipeline fold-change threshold is set to detect a minimum of 10 target copies (8 additional copies) at 50% neoplastic cell content. Consequently, the amplification statuses for genes with WGS copy numbers below 10 were classified as "not amplified" for comparison against the PanSolid NGS results. The results from the PanSolid pipeline compared to the results from WGS are shown in @tbl-wgs-comparison, and the sensitivity and specificity are shown in @tbl-wgs-comparison-metrics.

### WGS discordant results {#sec-wgs-discordant-result}

There was a single false negative result: for sample 24030962, which was extracted using the QIAsymphony method, PanSolid NGS did not detect an amplification for *EGFR*, whilst DNA extracted from fresh frozen tissue form the sample pathology block (23033921) had an *EGFR* amplification of 14 copies detected on NGS. The same DNA from fresh-frozen tissue showed a borderline *EGFR* fold change of 2.7 when tested using PanSolid NGS.

To investigate this discrepancy, both DNA samples were tested by ddPCR for *EGFR*. The ddPCR showed similar results to PanSolid NGS, with the QIAsymphony-extracted DNA having a normal *EGFR* result whilst the DNA from fresh-frozen tissue had a borderline *EGFR* amplification. This indicates that the discrepancy between the PanSolid NGS result for QIAsymphony-extracted DNA and the WGS result is due to intra-tumour heterogeneity for *EGFR* copy number in the specimens used for DNA extraction.

There were 5 amplifications in the *EGFR* and *MDMD2* genes detected by both WGS and PanSolid. @fig-egfr-wgs-pansolid and @fig-mdm2-wgs-pansolid show that the PanSolid pipeline identified shorter amplified regions than WGS, which correspond to the regions targeted by PanSolid QIAseq primers.

### *EGFR* version 3 {#sec-results-egfr-v3}

In a sample from pathology block N23.0626 (PanSolid NGS lab number: 24030966; WGS lab number: 23034780), PanSolid NGS showed 2 amplified regions in the *EGFR* gene, with a boundary at the end of *EGFR* exon 7. Inspection of the interactive HTML showed that this was caused by a loss of log2 ratios in the region between exons 2 to 7 (@fig-egfr-viii-html), indicating the presence of the *EGFR* version 3 transcript. This result was confirmed by WGS.

### WGS dosage correlation {#sec-wgs-dosage-correlation}

There were only 5 samples with amplifications detected on PanSolid and WGS, which is not enough to perform a robust correlation analysis on. However, there was a general agreement between the two methods on the dosage of each gene (Supplementary Information (@fig-wgs-pansolid-dosage)).

### SeraCare reference materials {#sec-results-lod-seracare-neat}

The Seraseq® TNA (DNA) WT Mix was tested on the PanSolid v2 enrichment on worksheet WS144291 and the +3 copies, +6 copies and +12 copies reference materials were tested on worksheet WS139890. There were six genes of interest, *BRAF*, *EGFR*, *ERBB2*, *MET*, *MYC* and *MYCN*, which had artificial gene constructs spiked into the SeraCare reference materials. In the +12 copies and +6 copies materials, all 6 genes of interest were detected by the PanSolid pipeline (@fig-seracare-pansolid-results), with the amplification regions covering the full width of each gene. In the +3 copies reference material, *BRAF* and *MYC* were not detected, although they had fold changes close to the threshold and were visibly amplified on the generated whole genome plot (@fig-seracare-control-results-png).

### SeraCare dilution mixes {#sec-results-lod-seracare-mixes}

Dilution mixes were prepared to simulate a sample with neoplastic cell contents of 30%, 20%, 10 % and 0%, and were tested on the PanSolid v2 enrichment on worksheet WS144291. All genes except *MYC* were detected at a simulated NCC of 30%, whilst below this level no genes exceeded the fold change threshold of 2.8.

There were `r nrow(repeat_noise_data)` replicates for inclusion in the repeat testing study. Sample replicate 24017319c on worksheet WS144291 failed due to poor coverage.
The pooled standard deviation was calculated using `r nrow(repeat_data_fold_change_range)` data points from the maximum and minimum fold changes for each gene in each sample replicate, excluding the *MYC* results for sample 24027774 . The *MYC* results for sample 24027774 were excluded because the fold changes were all over 75 and there was greater variability (@fig-repeatability).
The intra-run pooled standard deviation in the fold change range of -2 to 10 was `r intra_pooled_sd`, and the inter-run pooled standard deviation for the same fold change range was `r inter_pooled_sd`. For the 3 amplifications detected, there was no change in the region defined as amplified in any of the repeat replicates (Supplementary Information @fig-24020998-EGFR, @fig-24027774-MYC and @fig-24027774-MET).

Within the poor-quality samples, there were 7 gene amplification calls (@tbl-noisy-amplification-calls). The calls in the *ERBB2* and *MDM2* genes had very high fold changes, and result was confirmed on ddPCR and WGS, respectively. In contrast, the remaining calls had low fold change values; inspection of the whole genome plots showed that gene targets were not significantly elevated above their surrounding targets (@fig-sample-23032153-whole-genome). This indicated that these were false positive calls, caused by the high noise in the samples.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## Comparison to WGS {#sec-discussion-wgs}

In the NHS Genomic Medicine Service, WGS is performed by Illumina Laboratory Solutions and analysed using a bioinformatics pipeline developed by Genomics England. The Genomics England cancer pipeline performs analysis for somatic CNVs and structural variants [@genomicsengland2023], using the Canvas [@roller2016] and Manta [@chen2016] algorithms, respectively. The Genomics England cancer pipeline has been validated to have a sensitivity of 79.3% for CNV detection and 88.8% for structural variant detection, when compared to results from Fluorescent In Situ Hybridisation (FISH) [@genomicsengland2019]. The results from the PanSolid CLC pipeline compared favourably with WGS, with only a single inconsistent result for a gene with a copy number above 10. Additional ddPCR testing showed that this inconsistent result likely reflects intra-tumour heterogeneity between the fresh frozen sample being tested by WGS and the FFPE material used for PanSolid NGS. This is a limitation of using WGS as an orthogonal test, as only DNA from fresh frozen tissue is accepted for WGS for somatic cancer testing.

## Comparison to ddPCR {#sec-discussion-ddpcr}

By comparison, ddPCR did not have this limitation as it was performed on the same DNA as PanSolid NGS. Out of 100 samples tested across 5 genes there were only 3 discordant results, 2 of which were borderline by both methods, and the other was likely due to a copy number change at the locus of the ddPCR reference gene, *AP3B1*.

## Quantification {#sec-discussion-quantification}

Section text to be added.

## Limit of detection {#sec-discussion-lod}

The limit of detection is impacted by multiple factors, such as the the NCC of the sample, the number of amplified gene copies in the tumour, the coverage across the locus of interest, the quantity of DNA available for the QIAseq enrichment, the size of the gene, the settings used in the pipeline, and the presence of intra-tumoral heterogeneity in gene copy number. Consequently, establishing a limit of detection for the PanSolid NGS workflow involves many caveats. 

Two approaches were used to determine the limit of detection: undiluted SeraCare reference materials with known quantities of target genes added, and mixtures of these controls to simulate clinical samples with different NCC values. All genes were detected in the +6 copies SeraCare control, and all genes except *MYC* were detected at 30% simulated NCC.

The limit of detection for the PanSolid NGS workflow is therefore:

- 6 additional copies with an NCC of 100%

- 12 additional copies with an NCC of 30% for *ALK*, *BRAF*, *EGFR*, *ERBB2*, *MET*, *MDM2*  *MYCN* and *SMO*, but not for *MYC*.

## Extrapolation to other genes {#sec-extrapolation-to-other-genes}

### "Coarse" setting {#sec-discussion-coarse-setting}

The CLC "coarse" setting was able to detect amplifications in 5 different genes, all containing over 10 target regions. Whilst no confirmed amplifications were detected in either the *ALK* or *SMO* genes, amplifications were detected in smaller genes with fewer targets. For example, amplifications were detected in the *MDM2* gene, which is smaller, has fewer primers and has fewer targets than both the *ALK* and *SMO* genes (@tbl-amplification-coordinates). This indicates that amplifications in *ALK* and *SMO* would be detected by the "coarse" setting.

Given the assumption that amplification dynamics are not radically different between target genes and genomic regions, the sensitivity and specificity for gene amplification detection on the CLC "coarse" setting in this validation dataset could be extrapolated to additional genes of similar sizes in future. This is a standard approach that is used to validate somatic CNV detection for large gene panels [@chandramohan2022], whole exome sequencing [@saldivar2023] and whole genome sequencing [@roepman2021; @genomicsengland2019].

### "Fine" setting {#sec-discussion-fine-setting}

*MYC* and *MYCN* are paralogous in their protein motifs and structures, but not nucleotide sequences [@jha2023] and are located on different chromosomes. Both genes are frequently mutated in cancer, with gene amplification being a major oncogenic mechanism [@meyer2008]. Both *MYC* and *MYCN* are shorter than 7 kilobases in length, and, due to their small size, amplifications were not initially detected in these genes on the "coarse" setting. The "fine" setting was then used, and was able to detect amplifications in both genes in the SeraCare reference materials, and *MYC* amplifications which were confirmed by ddPCR. Due to the small size of each gene, we do not advise extrapolating the sensitivity and specificity of the "fine" setting to other genes of similar sizes without testing controls with confirmed amplifications.

## *EGFR* version 3 and intra-genic CNVs {#sec-discussion-egfr-v3}

In a single sample, an exonic *EGFR* deletion was detected by PanSolid NGS, consistent with the result from WGS. This is a recurrent in-frame deletion of 801 EGFR coding base pairs, representing exons 2 to 7, which is referred to as *EGFR* version 3, Δ801EGFR, EGFR vIII or de2-7 EGFR [@sugawa1990; @pedersen2001]. EGFR version 3 is found in roughly 11% of glioblastoma cases [@brennan2013], but its prognostic significance is controversial [@rutkowska2019].

In this validation, the exonic deletion was visible when the individual QIAseq targets were inspected in the interactive HTML view. The CLC "coarse" setting identified two regions within *EGFR* with different fold changes, but did not identify the deleted region. This indicates that intra-genic CNVs within target genes can cause the CLC pipeline to return multiple intra-genic fold-changes, although these may not match the coordinates of the underlying CNV. 

## Quality control {#sec-discussion-quality-control}

False positive calls were observed for 2 samples extracted on the Cobas method with high signal-adjusted noise values. This demonstrates that visual inspection of the whole genome plots is required, and that amplification calls in samples with high signal-adjusted noise values should be treated with caution.

## Limitations {#sec-discussion-limitations}

This validation has the following limitations:

-   FISH is considered the gold standard test for many amplifications, but FISH data were not available for comparison.

-   Positive control samples were not available for the *ALK* and *SMO* genes.

-   All SeraCare reference materials were not tested by each ddPCR assay due to limited DNA volumes.

-   Short-read NGS is not able to distinguish the different cellular contexts of gene amplifications, which may be present on chromosomes or extra-chromosomal DNA.

- ddPCR was not performed for *MYCN* or *MDM2* as these genes were added later in the validation.

- Limit of detection studies were performed using SeraCare controls, which include artificial gene construct spike-ins and may not perfectly mimic the behaviour of clinical FFPE samples.

# Review of test requirements {#sec-discussion-test-requirements-review}

The test requirements specified in @sec-requirements have been met:

**1. Clinical utility: the test should provide clear results for the 9 listed amplification markers.**

The PanSolid Excel output provides a clear result of the amplification status for all 9 genes.

**2. Clinical validity: the test should have a defined sensitivity and specificity for these markers, calculated by comparison with an orthogonal test.**

The amplification detection has a sensitivity and specificity of 93.8% and 100% when compared to ddPCR (@sec-results-ddpcr-comparison),and a sensitivity and specificity of 83.3% and 100% when compared to WGS (@sec-results-wgs-comparison).

**3. Dosage accuracy: it should be shown how accurate the test is at detecting amplifications of different copy number states, expressed as a correlation between the test and copy numbers from an orthogonal test.**

There is a strong correlation between the dosages determined by PanSolid NGS and ddPCR for the genes investigated, with R values ranging from 0.78 to 1.0 (@sec-ddpcr-dosage-correlation).

**4. Quality control: the test should have clear quality control thresholds for deciding when the test results should be reported and when the test has failed.**

Low-level false positive calls were seen when the signal-adjusted noise value exceeded 0.7, although confirmed amplifications were also detected above this threshold (@sec-results-quality-control). Samples with signal-adjusted noise values above 0.7 with no amplifications identified should be failed.

**5. Variability: the test should have defined intra-run variation (repeatability) and inter-run variation (repeatability) for these amplifications.**

Intra-run pooled standard deviation in fold change in the range of -2 to 10 was `r intra_pooled_sd` and inter-run pooled standard deviation in fold change was  `r inter_pooled_sd` for the same range (@sec-results-repeat-testing).

**6. Visualisation: the results should be presented in a clear and visual manner.**

The results are displayed in graphical format in the output Excels with gene, CNV and whole genome views. There is also an interactive HTML whole-genome view which can assist genotyping complex cases.

**7. Analysis: there should be a clear procedure for analysis of copy number variants by laboratory staff.**

[DOC6261 (Somatic Copy Number Variant Analysis on the PanSolid Cancer Panel)]{custom-style="Strong"} will be updated with new screenshots and instructions for how to analyse the PanSolid CLC output for these additional genes.

# Requirements for clinical implementation {#sec-requirements-for-clinical-implementation}

This validation has identified the following requirements for the clinical implementation of this test:

- Samples with signal-adjusted noise values aboive 0.7 should be analysed carefully. Confirmed amplifications have been detected in samples with high levels of noise, but low-level gene gains may in fact be false positives.

- Visual inspection of the whole genome plots is required to avoid false positive calls, see @sec-results-quality-control.

- Visual inspection of the interactive HTML plots should be performed when there are multiple CNV regions called within the same gene, as this may indicate intra-genic CNVs.

# Conclusion {#ref-conclusion}

The PanSolid NGS workflow and CLC pipeline has been validated for the detected of gene amplifications in *ALK*, *BRAF*, *EGFR*, *ERBB2*, *MET*, *MDM2* *MYC*, *MYCN* and *SMO* at the North West GLH.
